This program pulls data from the web (mostly from Quandl), creates a training set of 39 inputs, trains a single layer Neural Netowrk, that uses binary classification to determine whether the value of the USD compared with CAD will increase (1) or decrease(0) in a specified number of days ahead.
It is a study to see how well this type of network can predict the outcome given fairly well known correlated values.

Data is normalized if the mean of the input was outside of the range 0.1:10.
many of the data values are not daily and therefore missing data is filled from previous values

The training set data has actual dates stripped off and each training example has no relation
